    <h2>Steps to make a Homemade Pizza</h2>

    <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</p>


        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>


        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</p>


        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or rall into a 12 inch circle.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
        <p>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving</p>

    </ol>
